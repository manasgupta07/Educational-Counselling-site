Although the majority of people imagine the artist as that one sad person with a beret, carrying an easel and canvas to sit by the mountainside. Arts, Design & Architecture is a degree programme that requires quirkiness and imagination, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Even the most creative artists need self-discipline and some strong communication skills to get through the door of a top design company or art gallery – all of which could be gained in a Master’s or Bachelor’s degree in Art. Combining theoretical notions with practice and a personal flair, students who follow Bachelor’s or Master’s degrees in such fields will need to find their own style and spend hours in a studio, all the while deciding if they want to freelance or find a job within the industries of their choice:<br><br>
