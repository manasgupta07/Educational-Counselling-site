          I’m sorry to break this to you, but the Earth is in trouble. Like, for real! It’s a matter of time until she will announce it’s time to shut down and go to bed, and that she’s not mad, just disappointed. Well, luckily, a Master’s degree in Environmental Studies & Earth Sciences will keep nature happy and help us do our share of chores around the house.
