       Ah, the age-old question: was Mathematics discovered or invented? To the person who invented it: Stop that! To those who discovered it: why couldn’t you just keep it to yourself? To the rest of us who merely learned it in school: if we have any hope for understanding and measuring the natural world, consider a Bachelor’s or a Master’s in the Natural Sciences and Mathematics.

      Studying all natural phenomena, with the purpose of understanding and capitalising on the unwritten (OK, now they are written) rules that surround us, the field of Natural Sciences and Mathematics is composed of a variety of subjects. They are categorised as either Life Sciences, with Ecology, Anatomy, Botany, or Agriculture; or Physical Sciences, such as Physics, Earth Sciences, Astronomy, or Chemistry. Students who graduate from these fields will find jobs in a multitude of fields, as Math is everywhere, used by everyone.<br><br>

Some of the most interesting careers are:<br><br>

• Statistics<br>
• Game Theory<br>
• Cryptography<br>
• Finance<br>
• Economics<br>
• Philosophy<br><br>

And if you think Mathematics is too predictable or dull, just wait till you attend a party with 2 matematicians arguing over the meaning of infinity.
