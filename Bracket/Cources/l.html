         “Objection”, shouts the lawyer; “order!” shouts the judge - all done in the name of dispensing justice. The judge and the lawyer in this scene have one thing in common: they’re showing off their law degrees. A Law degree deals with understanding and interpreting the rules (laws), statutes, decrees, and regulations that govern social behaviour. The dignified men and women who practice it daily do so for the sake of maintaining lawfulness and ensuring justice.

      Law is one of the oldest and most revered disciplines throughout history, so the expectations are high, but so are the rewards. Whether you decide to become a judge, become a defence attorney or a prosecutor, or focus on working within a specific organisation or company, you will be expected to have a high level of sophistication with the law, a vast vocabulary and excellent communication skills - everything backed by a great memory and strong analytical thinking.<br><br>

Law is one of those subjects you will find in every aspect of life. There’s no wonder, then, that Law degrees are offered in fields as diverse as:<br><br>

• European or International Law<br>
• Criminal, Civil, Public or Private Law<br>
• Patent & Intellectual Law<br><br>

Each one of these legal subdisciplines will give you in-depth knowledge of Constitutional Law, Legal Theory, Legal Systems, and Legal Institutions.  </span>
